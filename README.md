# Django_Apps

In This Project, I made two basic applicatations:
1: A new Year application that tells wether it is new year or not.
  What I used!
      - I used render function and Python Datetime library to check whether it is 1st of january, It displays "YES" or not, It displays "NO".
      - Simply uses return render(request) to fetch and Display the Results.
2: Task List.
-This Application allows you to add and delete Task you want.
  What I used!
      -I made html pages to add the tasks, Index.html and layout.html( this contains the basic layout that add.html and index.html inherits)
      -a static css files inherited to use the defined css in all the files.
      -Implemented sessions to create multiple sessions for multiple users.
      
How to use!
:Make sure Django and Python are installed correctly on your System.
:Run "python manage.py runserver" to run the app .
